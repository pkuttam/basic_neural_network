# basic_neural_network
A complete implementation of neural network with forward and back-propagation in python numpy for fitting a line

the code consists of 2 files ( linearNN.py and sigmoidNN.py) that has been implemented for forward pass and back propagation.
linearNN.py is fully conected layer
sigmoidNN.py is sigmoid layer
